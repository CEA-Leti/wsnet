# Labels

## Flow Labels
Certain labels are used to define the flow of issues :

An issue could be classified into:
- **idea** : a new idea that could be integrated 
- **design** : when the issue involves the design of an idea
- **in-progress** : the design has been defined and now is being implemented
- **test** : tests are being performed to check whether everything is fine
- **done** : the issue is closed (Note that there is no label for done)

In this way, we can see in the "Board" view what is under idea, design, in-progress, test and done.

## Subject Labels

Aside from the flow labels, we have the subject labels, which are used for relating the issue into an specific subject. 

These labels are :

- **bug** :  Related to bugs found.
- **feature** : Describes a new feature.
- **changelog** : Related to changes on the different versions.
- **code-cleanup** : Cleaning up code. 
- **code-review** : Reviewing pieces of code. 
- **code-style** : Related to code-style issues. 
- **doc** : Related to documentation and DOXYGEN.
- **improvement** : Updating a specific feature. (You should refer to the feature)
